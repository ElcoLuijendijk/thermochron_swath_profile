This repository contains a notebook to create a swath profile of thermochronology data, vitrinite reflectance, eelvation and stratigraphy along or perpendicular to a thrust front. The data contained in this notebook create a swath profile of data in the Molassa basin along  and perpendicular to the northernmost Alpine thrust fault.

You can run this notebook in google colab using the following link: http://colab.research.google.com/github/ElcoLuijendijk/thermochron_swath_profile/thermochron_swath_profile.ipynb
