This repository contains a notebook to create a swath profile of thermochronology data, vitrinite reflectance, eelvation and stratigraphy along or perpendicular to a thrust front. The data contained in this notebook create a swath profile of data in the Molassa basin along  and perpendicular to the northernmost Alpine thrust fault.

The notebook can be found here:[thermochron_swath_profile.ipynb](thermochron_swath_profile.ipynb)

To run this you need to install the following Python modules: 
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* matplotlib
* shapely
* fiona
* gdal

All of these dependencies can be easily installed using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
